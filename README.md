## sockets

this is a repository to play around with sockets and maybe http. i started it with code from a NeuralNine [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UOyky9sEQY)/[blog post](https://www.neuralnine.com/tcp-chat-in-python/) and i will be updating it in my style and adding new functionality/languages. [this](https://github.com/bfgray3/sockets/compare/1ecf16efefba1d0ce9a07095eb64c740f73ff98b..main) is the diff to the starter code from Neuralnine.
